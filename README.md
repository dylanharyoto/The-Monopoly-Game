# The Monopoly Game

## Overview

The Monopoly Game is played on a board divided into 20 squares with a pair of four-sided (tetrahedral) dice. It accommodates 2 to 6 players.

## Game Setup

- **Starting Money**: Each player begins with HKD 1500 and no properties.
- **Starting Position**: All players start from the first square.

## Gameplay

1. **Turns**: Players take turns rolling the dice and advancing their tokens clockwise on the board. After reaching square 20, a token moves back to square 1.
  
2. **Square Effects**: Certain squares have effects when a player's token passes or lands on them, which can affect the player's money.

3. **Retirement**: If a player ends their turn with a negative amount of money, they retire from the game, and all their properties become unowned.

4. **Rounds**: A round consists of all players taking their turns once. The game ends if only one player remains or after 100 rounds. The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game. Ties are possible.

## Board Squares

There are seven types of squares on the board:

1. **Property Squares**: 
   - Marked by a colored stripe, these contain the property name and price.
   - Players can buy unowned properties or pay rent if they land on owned properties (rent amounts are listed in Table 1).

2. **Go**: 
   - Players receive a salary of HKD 1500 every time they pass through this square.

3. **Chance**: 
   - Landing on this square results in a random gain (multiple of 10) up to HKD 200 or a loss (multiple of 10) up to HKD 300.

4. **Income Tax**: 
   - Players landing here pay 10% of their money (rounded down to a multiple of 10) as tax.

5. **Free Parking**: 
   - This square has no effect.

6. **Go to Jail**: 
   - Landing here sends a player directly to the "In Jail" section.

7. **In Jail/Just Visiting**: 
   - Landing here has no effect unless the player arrived by landing on "Go to Jail." If so, the player is in jail and cannot move.

## Jail Rules

- A player can get out of jail by:
  - Throwing doubles on any of their next three turns, moving forward by the number shown on the dice.
  - Paying a fine of HKD 150 before rolling the dice on either of their next two turns.

- If doubles are not thrown by the third turn, the player must pay the HKD 150 fine, then moves forward the number of spaces shown by their throw.

Enjoy playing Monopoly!
