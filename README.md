The Monopoly Game

The game is played with a board divided into 20 squares (as shown in Figure 1) and a pair of four-
sided (tetrahedral) dice, and it can accommodate two to six players.

It works as follows:
• Players have money and can own
properties. Each player starts with HKD
1500 and no property.
• All players start from the first square.
• Players take turns rolling the dice and
advancing their respective tokens clockwise
on the board. After reaching square 20, a
token moves to square 1 again.
• Certain squares take effect on a player (see
below) when her token passes or lands on
the square. For example, they can change
the player’s amount of money.
• If, after taking a turn, a player has a negative
amount of money, she retires from the
game. All her properties become unowned.
• A round consists of all players taking their
turns once.
• The game ends either if only one player is left or
after 100 rounds. The winner is the player with the
most money at the end of the game. Ties (multiple
winners) are possible.
There are seven kinds of squares on the board:
• Property squares (marked by a colored stripe).
They contain the property's name and price and can
be owned by players. If a player lands on an
unowned property, she can choose to buy it for the
written price or do nothing. If a player lands on a
property owned by another player, she has to pay
rent (rent amounts are listed in Table 1).
• Go. Every time a player passes through (not
necessarily lands on) this square, she gets a salary of HKD1500.
• Chance. If a player lands on one of these squares, she either gains a random amount
(multiple of 10) up to HKD200 or loses a random amount (multiple of 10) up to HKD300.
• Income tax. If a player lands on this square, she pays 10% of her money (rounded down
to a multiple of 10) as tax.
• Free parking. This square has no effect.
• Go to Jail. If a player lands on this square, she immediately goes to the “In Jail” part of the
“In Jail/Just Visiting” square.
In Jail/Just Visiting. If a player lands on this square, she is “Just Visiting”: the square has no
effect. However, if the player gets here by landing on “Go to Jail,” she is in jail and cannot make a
move. A player gets out of jail by either throwing doubles (i.e., both dice coming out the same
face up) on any of her next three turns (if she succeeds in doing this, she immediately moves
forward by the number of spaces shown by her doubles throw) or paying a fine of HKD 150
before she rolls the dice on either of her next two turns. If the player does not throw doubles by
her third turn, she must pay the HKD 150 fine. She then gets out of jail and immediately moves
forward the number of spaces shown by her throw.
